# MyWeb
My own LVM ArchLinux dualboot Debian.
I'll push a new version with a faster boot.
1-ArchLinux:
-> architecture: 1 partition /dev/sda1 with 4 subpartitions (rooot, home, boot, swap) ;
-> display manager: LightDM display manager ;
-> graphic environment: xfce4

2-Debian:
-> architecture: 4 partitions with: root && home on primary and boot && swap on extended partitions ;
-> graphic environment: Cinnamon

SSH Server is enable on ArchLinux and Debien.

PS: if it's your lucky day, send me a message for the passwords :)

Have a good boot.
